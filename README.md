## This code should NOT be used in production

Although we believe that this software is a complete and functional product,
which should be secure and reliable, we can't guarantee this. There may be
security flaws or other issues with our design which could lead to bad things
happening. Unless you review this code and make sure it meets your needs for
security and reliability, you should not use it except for demonstration and
testing purposes.
