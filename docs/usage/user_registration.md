# User registration

In order for other users to log into the forum, they must have a username and
password registered with the external authentication system, and must also be
added to the forum by an administrator. From the admin panel, an administrator
can specify the group they wish to add the new users to, before entering user
details for any new users they wish to register. When the submit button is
clicked, the new users will be registered to the server and can now log in.
Note that owing to constraints on the login system, there is no way to
validate that any particular user account exists ahead of time, so entering an
incorrect username will result in that user being unable to log in as the
authentication server will never approve their account.
