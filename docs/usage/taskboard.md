# Q&A management

One of the most common issues we found in alternative forums was the ease at
which posts could get buried. In order to address this, we have implemented a
system for managing unanswered posts that allows them to be delegated into
categories so that they wonâ€™t be forgotten. We call this system the Taskboard.

Moderators and administrators can access the taskboard view as one of the tabs
at the top of the UI. This view provides a collection of columns where posts
can be moved in order to categorise them. By default, all posts appear in the
main queue, but after an administrator has created more queues, the posts can
be dragged to these other queues. Moderators can also follow certain queues so
that they will receive a notification if any other user adds a post to that
queue.

We intend for administrators to create various queues for the major topics of
their course, so that experts in those particular topics can follow those
queues and ensure that the most complex questions from those topics get
answered by someone who has the knowledge to be able to give a detailed and
informative response.
