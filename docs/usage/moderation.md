# Forum moderation

In order to make it easy to keep things under control on the forum, we provide many tools to allow moderators and administrators to manage content.

## Closing posts

If a post does not provide enough information for it to receive an answer,
moderators can close the post, which hides it from the main browse page and
notifies the original creator that the post was closed. The creator of the
post can then reopen the post by editing it, allowing for them to have a
second chance at getting an answer.

## Deleting posts

If a post is abusive or otherwise inappropriate for the forum, moderators can
delete it, which hides it from the main browse page, and notifies the original
creator that the post was deleted. Unlike closing a post, a deleted post
cannot be restored by the original creator. Although the behaviour of closed
and deleted posts is similar, they are intended to be used in very different
situations, which is why we consider them to be distinct features.

## Reporting posts

If any user believes a post is inappropriate, they can report it, which will
notify all moderators about the post.

## Blocking users

As mentioned in the section describing permissions, users can be blocked from
interacting with the forum by disabling their PostCreate and PostComment
permissions.

## Exam mode

During times when students should not be communicating with each other, exam
mode can be enabled, which prevents users from creating public posts.
