## Search

If a user believes that their question may have already been asked, they can
search for it by entering a query into the search box. This will filter the
post list so that they are only shown posts that are similar to what they are
looking for.

One particular feature of this is the ability to quickly convert a search
query to a new post, which is very useful for when users don’t find a post
that matches their question.

## Notifications

For many events on the forum, users can receive notifications to stay in the
loop. For example, if someone comments on a user’s post, they will receive a
notification that allows them to quickly jump to that content.
