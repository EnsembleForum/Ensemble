## Week 1

### Thursday

In week 1, we got into teams. Andrew and Neel were away, so they couldn't
participate in the discussion. I proposed that we do a course forum as a custom
project as I believe that is something I will be able to find motivation and
inspiration for. We drafted an initial project proposal with a few ideas.

* Exam mode
* Triage queue system

Although I came up with the initial idea for the triage queue, it was
developed, refined and transformed by the group to the point where I consider
it to be the work of the group.

## Week 2

### Monday

Our initial proposal was rejected as it wasn't clear that it was a big enough
workload. Sesi, Yuk and I worked to refine the system and give far more detail
on the complexities of our systems, however I fear we may have overcompensated
and become stuck with a highly complex project - we may need to reconsider our
goals if we realise they are unrealistic down the track. Our proposal this time
was accepted thankfully.

### Thursday

We also got access to the GitLab. I created an initial project structure
containing starter code as well as some dependencies we deemed essential. I
also helped to decide the tech stack we're using, particularly for the back-end
tooling. Hopefully I'll be able to use my experience with CI/CD to help
optimise our testing and deployment of the project.

## Week 3

### Monday

I made some initial progress on the project proposal. As of today, I've
completed a first draft of the background, but am still yet to do work on the
backend part of our tech stack. So far nobody else has started. Hopefully
they'll start soon so I can stop stressing.

I'll also do some work on getting a basic server running and sort out a folder
structure for the backend later.

## Tuesday

Added some starter code for the backend server, as well as documentation for
getting it to start. Build out a basic structure to contain all of the server
code.
