# The System Architecture and Design of Ensemble

Ensemble is structured as two servers; the frontend which powers the web UI, and the backend which provides the database and business logic. We also defined some tooling to assist with integration between the backend and frontend.

* [Backend](./backend.md)

* [Frontend](./frontend.md)

* [Integration](./integration.md)
