## Authentication

Allowing users to log in either using a dedicated account or using integration with their organisation’s existing login systems

\[EN-2\]

| Functionality | Jira code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Being able to initialise the forum via the init page | - | When the administrator sets up the course for the first time they are greeted with the init page. This page sets up the forum and given a set of details, this user is the first user and the administrator of the forum. From here, this user is able to register users, other administrators and moderators to the forum. | Whilst a story isn’t provided for this, this is an important part of authorisation as it allows for the first user to be assigned the role of the administrator. The administrator is then able to set up the forum i.e. register users, provide permissions, etc. Further, it is on this page that the administrator can integrate an institution’s sign in system into Ensemble. |
| Users are able to log in to Ensemble using their institution’s login details| EN-15 | Users of Ensemble are able to log in to access the forum using their institution’s login details. For example, they are able to login using their zID and password if the course is taught by UNSW. If the course is not taught by UNSW but by another institution, they are able to use their institution's sign-in system instead. | The ability for a user to log in using their UNSW login details (zID and password) meets the above objective as it demonstrates Ensemble’s ability to integrate an existing login system. This allows institutions to bypass making individual accounts and it also means that Ensemble can take advantage of the institution’s login system to enforce authentication. Thus, which in turn provides Ensemble’s system with a level of authentication and security. |
| Users are able to sign out of Ensemble. | EN-48 | Users of Ensemble are able to log out of the forum by clicking the “logout” button. | The ability of the user to log out of Ensemble ensures that the user’s account cannot be accessed by anyone other than the user, ensuring authentication. |

| Students  are able to make private posts | EN-62 | When students are making a post. They are able to select the checkbox ‘Private’. This means that, while students are not able to view the post, admin and moderators can see the post.

| Users are able to mark their post as answered by clicking ‘ ✅’ on a reply | EN-46 | When a user has received a reply that answers their post, they are able to mark it as answered by clicking ‘✅’ on the reply.

As well as which post holds the answer, so that those with a similar question are able to find the answer quickly. |
| Students  are able to make posts as a anonymous user | EN-63 | When students are making a post. They are able to select the checkbox ‘Anonymous’.

| Users  are able to make a comment on a post by clicking ‘ ↩️’ | EN-16 | When a user  views a post, they are able to leave a comment by clicking ‘↩️’ | Being able to comment addresses the objective by allowing students or staff to ask questions, provide feedback  and/or provide an answer to a post. |

## Browsing

Allowing users to view existing questions and answers

[EN-51]

| Functionality | JIRA code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Users are able to react to a comment with ‘👍’ to express thanks | EN-21 | Users are able to express their thanks to a comment by clicking  ‘👍’. This will increment the counter for the number of ‘thanks’ this person has received for their comment to a post. | As users browse through the forum and view the answers and questions they may want to communicate their thanks without having to comment.

| Students are able to indicate that they also have the same question without adding duplicate posts by clicking ‘✋’ | EN-8 | Users are able to express that they have the same question as a fellow student by clicking  ‘✋’. This will increment the counter for the number of ‘me too’ responses the post has received. | As students browse and view posts on the forum, they will want to efficiently and effectively communicate that they are experiencing the same issue or difficulty as their peers without having to create duplicate posts. They can do this by clicking the me too button (‘✋’).  The button will also help indicate to course staff that there is a question a lot of students are struggling with or a particular issue experienced by a majority of students. |
| Students are able to sort the comments on the post by the number of thanks received (referring to the ‘👍’ or thanks button) | EN-61 | As students click the ‘👍’ button, the comments will shift and sort themselves according to the number of clicks on the ‘👍’ button. The comments with the higher number of clicks are moved to the top and vice versa.    | As students browse and view posts, they will want to be able to see the post with the most amount of thanks or ‘👍’. This is because more ‘thanks’ would indicate a reply that has been helpful. Therefore, sorting answers according to the number of clicks of the ‘👍’ button would be helpful and make for efficient browsing and viewing of the forum and its posts. |
| Students are able to report a post by clicking the ‘❗’ button | EN-68 | When students find a post that needs to be reported they are able to do so by clicking ‘❗’ which will send the post to the reported queue. | As students browse and view posts, they may come across a post that needs to be reported.

| The number of times the me too button ( ✋) and thanks button ( 👍) have been clicked are displayed | EN-59 | As students browse and view posts in the forum, they are able to see at a glance the number of times another student from their course has clicked either button as the total number of clicks is visible on both buttons. | As students browse and view posts, being able to scan a post and instantly understand how prevalent a question is and which responses have been the most helpful makes for efficient browsing and improved user experience. |
| Users are able to see at a glance the state of the forum | EN-60 | Users are able to see the state of the forum in the browse page of the forum. When they click ‘Browse’ they are taken to a page. This page has all the posts made on Ensemble listed in the left sidebar. | Being able to see the state of the forum and the posts made on the forum is central to being able to browse and view posts. |
| Users are able to view a post on the forum | EN-58 | When the user selects a post from the left sidebar, details of the post are provided on the right hand side of the screen. | When users are browsing they will also want to be able to view a post and see the details.
