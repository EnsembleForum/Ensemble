## Authentication

Allowing users to log in either using a dedicated account or using integration with their organisation’s existing login systems

[EN-2]

| Functionality | Jira code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Being able to initialise the forum via the init page | - | When the administrator sets up the course for the first time they are greeted with the init page. This page sets up the forum and given a set of details, this user is the first user and the administrator of the forum. From here, this user is able to register users, other administrators and moderators to the forum. | Whilst a story isn’t provided for this, this is an important part of authorisation as it allows for the first user to be assigned the role of the administrator. The administrator is then able to set up the forum i.e. register users, provide permissions, etc. Further, it is on this page that the administrator can integrate an institution’s sign in system into Ensemble. |
| Users are able to log in to Ensemble using their institution’s login details| EN-15 | Users of Ensemble are able to log in to access the forum using their institution’s login details. For example, they are able to login using their zID and password if the course is taught by UNSW. If the course is not taught by UNSW but by another institution, they are able to use their institution's sign-in system instead. | The ability for a user to log in using their UNSW login details (zID and password) meets the above objective as it demonstrates Ensemble’s ability to integrate an existing login system. This allows institutions to bypass making individual accounts and it also means that Ensemble can take advantage of the institution’s login system to enforce authentication. Thus, which in turn provides Ensemble’s system with a level of authentication and security. |
| Users are able to sign out of Ensemble. | EN-48 | Users of Ensemble are able to log out of the forum by clicking the “logout” button. | The ability of the user to log out of Ensemble ensures that the user’s account cannot be accessed by anyone other than the user, ensuring authentication. |

## Posting

Allowing users to ask and answer questions

[EN-50/52]

| Functionality | JIRA code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Students  are able to make private posts | EN-62 | When students are making a post. They are able to select the checkbox ‘Private’. This means that, while students are not able to view the post, admin and moderators can see the post. The post will also be marked as private. | There may be students who are shy or uncomfortable with making a post in a public space. The ability to post privately gives these students the ability to ask questions privately - meaning their post is only visible to course staff. This provides students with an option to ask questions in a way that is most comfortable to them. |
| Users are able to mark their post as answered by clicking ‘ ✅’ on a reply | EN-46 | When a user has received a reply that answers their post, they are able to mark it as answered by clicking ‘✅’ on the reply. This will then apply a green highlight to the reply which will make it easy for others to see which reply contained the answer. | Users should be able to answer questions and this allows the original poster to indicate that their question has been answered to the members of the forum. As well as which post holds the answer, so that those with a similar question are able to find the answer quickly. |
| Students  are able to make posts as a anonymous user | EN-63 | When students are making a post. They are able to select the checkbox ‘Anonymous’. This means that, while admin and moderators can see the author’s name, students do not and only see “anonymous” as the name. The post will also be marked as anonymous. | This gives students, who may be shy or uncomfortable, the option to make a post without revealing their identity. It allows students to ask questions in a manner comfortable for them. |
| Users are able to edit posts they have submitted to the forum by clicking ‘ ✏️’ | EN-20 | When users want to make an edit to a post they have made they are able to click ‘ ✏️’. Then they are able to update the heading, body and tags of the post. Once the edit is made they click ‘post’ and now the edited post is viewable to the forum. | Part of being able to post and reply on forums, is the ability to edit these posts and replies. Whether this is in response to feedback e.g. question not clear, or to better articulate their issue or solution. Thus, the ability to edit is essential and supports the asking and answering of questions on the forum. |
| Users are able to comment on a post by clicking ‘ ↩️ ‘ | EN-10 | Users are able to make a comment on a post. This can be their own or a post made by another user. They are able to do this by navigating to the respective post and clicking ‘↩️’. | This allows for the facilitation of asking and answering questions. It does so by allowing users to either ask for further clarification or provide an answer to any of the questions asked in previous comments or by the original post. |
| Users are able to make a post on the forum by clicking the ‘new post’ button | EN-7 | When users are on the Browse page, they are able to make a post by clicking the ‘New Post’ button at the bottom right corner of the page. This opens a small popup, where the user is able to provide a heading, body and tags for the post. For students, they  are able to also select if they want to post anonymously or privately. Once they click ‘New Post’ again, they have now made a post to the forum. | Being able to make a post is crucial and necessary as this is how users  are able to ask a question on a forum. Therefore, this feature addresses the objective of asking a question. |
| Users  are able to reply to other replies  by clicking ‘ ↩️’ allowing them to follow threads of conversation | EN-19 | When a user views a post with comments made, they are able to respond to the comments themselves. They are able to do so by clicking ‘ ↩️’ to reply to the comment. | Being able to reply to a comment made in response to a post is important to obtaining the objective. It allows students to ask questions in an existing conversation or provide answers to the questions being asked within a post. |
| Users  are able to make a comment on a post by clicking ‘ ↩️’ | EN-16 | When a user  views a post, they are able to leave a comment by clicking ‘↩️’ | Being able to comment addresses the objective by allowing students or staff to ask questions, provide feedback  and/or provide an answer to a post. |

## Browsing

Allowing users to view existing questions and answers

[EN-51]

| Functionality | JIRA code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Users are able to react to a comment with ‘👍’ to express thanks | EN-21 | Users are able to express their thanks to a comment by clicking  ‘👍’. This will increment the counter for the number of ‘thanks’ this person has received for their comment to a post. | As users browse through the forum and view the answers and questions they may want to communicate their thanks without having to comment. The  ‘👍’ button provides for this, allowing for efficient and effective communication whilst browsing and viewing posts and comments on the forum. |
| Students are able to indicate that they also have the same question without adding duplicate posts by clicking ‘✋’ | EN-8 | Users are able to express that they have the same question as a fellow student by clicking  ‘✋’. This will increment the counter for the number of ‘me too’ responses the post has received. | As students browse and view posts on the forum, they will want to efficiently and effectively communicate that they are experiencing the same issue or difficulty as their peers without having to create duplicate posts. They can do this by clicking the me too button (‘✋’).  The button will also help indicate to course staff that there is a question a lot of students are struggling with or a particular issue experienced by a majority of students. |
| Students are able to sort the comments on the post by the number of thanks received (referring to the ‘👍’ or thanks button) | EN-61 | As students click the ‘👍’ button, the comments will shift and sort themselves according to the number of clicks on the ‘👍’ button. The comments with the higher number of clicks are moved to the top and vice versa. | As students browse and view posts, they will want to be able to see the post with the most amount of thanks or ‘👍’. This is because more ‘thanks’ would indicate a reply that has been helpful. Therefore, sorting answers according to the number of clicks of the ‘👍’ button would be helpful and make for efficient browsing and viewing of the forum and its posts. |
| Students are able to report a post by clicking the ‘❗’ button | EN-68 | When students find a post that needs to be reported they are able to do so by clicking ‘❗’ which will send the post to the reported queue. | As students browse and view posts, they may come across a post that needs to be reported. Instead of having to contact the course to remove the post, they are able to efficiently browse through the forum and report posts with a click of the ‘❗’ button. |
| The number of times the me too button ( ✋) and thanks button ( 👍) have been clicked are displayed | EN-59 | As students browse and view posts in the forum, they are able to see at a glance the number of times another student from their course has clicked either button as the total number of clicks is visible on both buttons. | As students browse and view posts, being able to scan a post and instantly understand how prevalent a question is and which responses have been the most helpful makes for efficient browsing and improved user experience. |
| Users are able to see at a glance the state of the forum | EN-60 | Users are able to see the state of the forum in the browse page of the forum. When they click ‘Browse’ they are taken to a page. This page has all the posts made on Ensemble listed in the left sidebar. | Being able to see the state of the forum and the posts made on the forum is central to being able to browse and view posts. |
| Users are able to view a post on the forum | EN-58 | When the user selects a post from the left sidebar, details of the post are provided on the right hand side of the screen. | When users are browsing they will also want to be able to view a post and see the details. Examples of a post’s details include the question, any comments made, number of reactions, etc. which are available when users view a post on Ensemble. |

## Notifications

Allowing users to keep up with events that are relevant to them

[EN-53]

| Functionality | JIRA code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
|-------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| The user who made the post is notified that their post has been answered | EN-9 | When the user who made the post, has an answer (occurs when a reply is marked as the answer by clicking ✅), they are sent a notification. This notification will be found under the notification page. | Users want to be able to keep up with what is happening on the forum and to their posts. By providing the user with a notification once an answer has been marked and provided, we are keeping our users in the loop regarding the activity happening on their post as expressed by the objective. |
| When a user’s comment/reply was originally marked as the answer to a post, but is then unmarked, the user receives a notification | EN-57 | When a user, whose comment has been marked as the answer (it will be highlighted in green in the post) has been unmarked as the answer to a post the user receives a notification. A comment/reply that was originally an answer, becomes unmarked as one by clicking ✅. The notification will appear on the notifications page and it will alert the user that their comment/reply to a post has been unmarked as an answer. | Users want to be kept up to date on what’s happening on the forum, in particular what happens to their posts and comments/replies. In this instance, it fulfils the objective as a user is notified when their answer is no longer one. This is helpful for tutors in particular, who are now alerted that a question has not been answered entirely and may require further explanation and clarification. |
| Each post made is given a status that is visible on the post. This status tells the user, who made the post, it’s status in the triage queue. This status is also available to moderators and administrators but not to other students | EN-35 | When a post is made, it is added to the main queue. This is indicated to the user who made the post (as well as moderators and administrators) on the post. | As stated previously, users want to be kept up to date with the progress of their posts. By having the queue status of the post visible, it keeps the user who made the post updated on the progress of the post. |
| When a user’s post has been deleted they will receive a notification alerting them that this has occurred | EN-67 | When a user has made a post, and a moderator or administrator has chosen to delete it (by clicking 🗑️), the user is then sent a notification. This notification will appear in the notification page to alert the user that their post has been deleted. | Users want to be kept up to date with the progress and state of their posts. The sending of notifications to users upon their post being deleted fulfils this by keeping the user updated on the status of their post - in this case it has been deleted. |

## Searching

Allowing users to find existing posts

[EN-54]

| Functionality | JIRA code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
|-------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| The search bar allows users to search for posts | EN-11 | The user is able to type their question or search terms in the search bar in the left hand side bar. They are then returned in relevant posts in the left hand side bar. | The ability to search using a search bar supports users in their search amongst existing posts for relevant posts that may contain the answer. |
| A search query is able to be transformed into a question the user can use to make a post | EN-56 | When the user is searching the forum for related posts, they are able to do so by using the search bar in the top left hand corner. If the posts they have found are not satisfactory or closely related, they can click the ‘❓’ button next to the search bar. This will then take the words from the search bar and transform it as a heading for a new post. The user is then able to fill out the rest of relevant details and submit the post to the forum. | This feature is one of our novel features. When a user has not been able to find a satisfactory search result for their question, this feature helps users continue their search for an answer. It transforms their query into a heading for a new post, which they can submit to the forum so that course staff are able to help the user find an answer. |

## Profile options

Allowing users to express themselves

[EN-36]

| Functionality | JIRA code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
|-------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Users can update their first name and last name which will update their display name | EN-39 | When the student is on the profile page, they can click the ‘✏️’ button next to their first name and last name. This will then allow users to edit the name. They can then press change to finalise and update their respective first and/or last name.  | This feature addresses the objective as it allows users to update, change and customise their name - an integral part of their identity as a person and on the forum. Which allows them to better express themselves to others. |
| Users are able to provide and change their pronouns | EN-40 | When the user is on the profile page, they can click the ‘✏️’ button for ‘pronouns’ to provide them, or change their existing pronouns. Once they click ‘change’ their pronouns will be updated. These pronouns will be viewable by others on the forum. | This feature addresses the objective as it allows users to provide and update their pronouns at any time. This allows them to express themselves to others as members of the forum are able to view the pronouns of other members. |
| Users have a display name that is visible to other members of the forum | EN-38 | When users are registered on the forum they are given a display name visible to other members of the forum. The display name is their first name and their last name. | This feature addresses the objective as it allows users to have a name to identify themselves on the forum. This allows them to express themselves and who they are to others as members of the forum who are able to view their display name. |

## Tutor tools

Allowing tutors to have advanced features to efficiently answer questions

[EN-13]

| Functionality | JIRA code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
|-------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Tutors are able to close posts | EN-18 | As a tutor views posts, if they want to close a post, they can click ‘🔒’. The post is then moved from the main queue to the closed queue. The post is also only viewable by the user who made the post as well as tutors and administrators and is highlighted in a blue colour to clearly mark its status as closed. Other users of the forum are not able to see the post. When the user who made the post edits the post, the post is no longer closed. | This feature addresses the objective by giving tutors a tool to organise the forum. Tutors are able to close a post that requires improvement i.e. question is unclear. The post is then removed from the forum for regular users so their browsing experience is improved. For tutors they can see at a glance which posts have been closed (blue highlight and moved to closed queue). Subsequently, they can easily understand what posts are unanswered and focus their attention there, improving their efficiency in answering the questions that need their attention. |
| Tutors are able to delete posts | EN-24 | As a tutor views posts, if they want to delete a post, they can click ‘ 🗑️’. The post is now only visible to the user who made the post, and the tutors and administrators. Other users are not able to see the post anymore. The post is also moved to the delete queue. Both the user who made the post and course staff are notified that the post has been deleted which they will find in the notifications tab. | This feature addresses the objective by providing tutors a tool to organise and maintain the forum. This enables them to efficiently answer questions, as the forum and the queue is not clogged with posts that do not need to be answered. An example of this is when a tutor sees a post that, for reasons, should be deleted from the forum i.e. the post uses unacceptable language. They are able to click the ‘ 🗑️’ button to remove it from the forum. The post is no longer viewable by any other user of the forum besides the tutors, administrators and the user who made the post. |
| Tutors can follow queues | EN-49 | A tutor is able to follow a queue that they are interested in by clicking the ‘ 🙋’ button. This means that when a post is moved to this queue, the tutor will receive a notification which will appear in the notifications tab. | This feature addresses the objective as the system proactively assists the tutors in efficiently answering questions. Tutors who follow a queue, are notified the moment a post is added to the queue and can view and address the post in a timely manner reducing the number of posts to be answered in the forum. |
| Tutors are alerted that they are about to mention the poster’s name when the post has been marked anonymous | EN-65 | When a tutor is replying to a post that has been marked anonymous, they are not supposed to reveal the anonymous user’s name. When the tutor is typing their response (reply or comment) and types the user’s display name (first and last name), upon click send, an alert will appear. This alert will tell the user that they have mentioned the user’s display name even though the post is marked anonymous. The tutor is then able to proceed with sending it or cancel sending it. | This feature addresses the objective, as it prevents tutors from making mistakes due a lack of attention to detail that can occur, especially after answering questions for a long period of time. By alerting the tutor before they send the message, they are able to rectify the mistake, instead of having to follow up on the error at a later time. Thus, increasing the efficiency in which tutors can answer questions. |
| Tutors are able to see the display name of the author who made an anonymous post | EN-64 | When a tutor is viewing an anonymous post, they are able to see the display name of the user who made the post. | This addresses the objective, as it allows the tutors to recognise who made the post. Tutors may be able to glean extra information from this i.e. this is a student from their tutorial that expressed a difficulty with the topic of their post. This allows tutors to provide a more tailored answer to students, despite the post being made anonymously. This improves the efficiency of answering questions as tutors are able to assess instantly the depth and angle they will need to take in their answers. The quality of answers should be improved as a result, which will hopefully reduce the number of questions students will need to ask and increase the number of questions marked answered. |
| Tutors are able to create queues for certain topics and move posts into these specialised queues | EN-28 | Tutors who feel that a specialised queue for a topic of question that appears on the forum can create a dedicated queue by pressing ‘➕’ on the task board page. All tutors need to do is to provide a name and click ‘Create Queue’. Once the queue is made, a tutor can go to the post in any other queue, and move the post into the specialised queue. | This addresses the objective as it allows for posts to be organised into specialised queues that cover a particular topic. Tutors, who are well versed in these areas, are then able to focus their time and attention to answering the questions they are most confident in answering. This would ultimately improve efficiency as the posts would always be given to tutors with the most knowledge on the topic and who are able to answer the post in a timely and detailed manner as a result. |
| Tutors are able to view all queues in the forum at a glance to assess which areas of the forum require their immediate attention | EN-29 | When the tutor clicks ‘Taskboard’ they are brought to the task board page. On the task board page they are able to see all the queues that exist within the forum. | This addresses the objective as it allows the tutor to see at a glance the status of the forum. This allows tutors to see which queues need their attention and they can then focus their attention on answering these questions. Thus, allowing for efficient Q&A management. |

## Administrator tools

Allowing course admins to manage the forum

[EN-5]

| Functionality | JIRA code | Description | How does it address the objective? |
|-------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Administrator is able to view analytics regarding forum activity | EN-25 | When the administrator is on the admin page, they are able to select ‘Analytics’. This will bring them to a page that provides them with forum related information such as the top posters, top repliers, etc. | This addresses the objective as it provides administrators with insight into the activity occurring within the forum which will help them in their management and moderation of the forum. |
| Administrators are able to create tags which can be used by all users of the forum to organise and categorise posts | EN-27 | When the administrator is on the admin page, they are able to select ‘Manage tags’. On this page they are able to create a list of tags that users can select from when writing their post. | This addresses the objective as it provides administrators the ability to create tags that will be used by all users to categorise and organise the forum. |
| Administrators can activate exam mode when an exam is taking place | EN-30 | When the administrator is on the admin page, they are able to click ‘Exam mode’. This will then allow students to post on the forum only if they post privately. If a student tries to make a public post they will receive an alert telling them they are unable to do this. | This addresses the objective as it allows the administrator to manage the influx of posts made during an exam. To ensure that private information regarding a students’ circumstances or exam code is not revealed to other students, the forum enforces private posting rather than relying on students to remember to post privately. |
| Administrators are able to register users and create accounts for them | EN-47 | When the administrator is on the admin page, if they click the ‘register users’ tab they are able to register individual users. | This addresses the objective as administrators can manage the forum - which includes the need to register students so that they are able to access the forum. |
| Administrators are able to register users and create accounts in bulk | EN-14 | When the administrator is on the admin page, if they click the ‘register users’ tab they are able to register users in bulk. | This addresses the objective as administrators can manage the forum - which includes the need to register students so that they are able to access the forum. However, administrators are able to do so in bulk which saves the administrator time. |
| Administrators are able to manage permissions | EN-37 | When the administrator is on the admin page, if they click “Manage user permissions” they are able to create and manage the permissions group permissions and user permissions. | This addresses the objective as administrators are able to manage what users are able to do according to the group they belong to and functionality individual users may need. An example is that administrators are able to assign tutors with moderator permissions. This will allow tutors access to the task board and associated tools for moderation and Q&A management. |
